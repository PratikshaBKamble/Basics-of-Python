# Python Collections (Arrays)
#### There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

### List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
### Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
### Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
### Dictionary is a collection which is ordered* and changeable. No duplicate members.

Dictionary Methods
Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on dictionaries.

Method	Description
clear()	Removes all the elements from the dictionary
copy()	Returns a copy of the dictionary
